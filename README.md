# **Customer Churn Analysis Using Power BI**


## **INTRODUCTION**
Customer churn is not merely a statistic or a metric; it represents a missed opportunity and a potential warning sign for any business. When customers decide to discontinue their relationship with a company, it not only affects revenue and profitability but also has broader implications for brand reputation, customer loyalty, and overall growth. 
In this project, I will explore the multifaceted nature of customer churn and its implications. We will examine the underlying reasons behind churn, such as subpar customer experiences, lack of personalization, and failure to meet evolving customer needs. By understanding these root causes, we can begin to address them head-on and develop proactive strategies to mitigate churn.
